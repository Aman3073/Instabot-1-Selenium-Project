# Instructions For running the codes -
1. Please run the codes in sequence as given as the functions are dependent on each other and also there might be the page that is opened already is used.
2. If the code gives some exceptions then please re-run it might be due data transmission although i have included sleep commands to get the elements loaded completely.
3. I have printed some variables that are not asked to be printed that is just for sake of clarity of what's happening.
4. In The 2nd , i have writen in very much detail about working of code,so please refer to that cause i have done 3 parts of question using same function.
5. If a code doesn't run or give errors, please re-run it , it will surely work i have checked all the codes twice.
